Third Party Assets: 
  - Billiard Ball Texture from ShareCG.com

Wizard Functionality:
  - A Billiard Bame implemented for Stage 2 (You need to shoot every ball into the hole and finally the white one.)
  - AngryBee Control implemented (Arrow keys and WASD no longer works)
  - Billiard Ball Texture added
  - Ball rotation animation added (It looks weird, maybe I will fix it later)
